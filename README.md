# üö¢ Anomaly Detection in Ship Engine Data
Statistical and machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance using multivariate sensor data.

## Overview
This project applies statistical and machine learning frameworks to detect anomalous activity in ship engines using real-world sensor data. Poorly maintained engines can cause safety risks, fuel inefficiencies, and costly downtime.

## Data
Devabrat, M., 2022. Predictive Maintenance on Ship's Main Engine using AI. Available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/g3za-v415. The data set contains six important features continuously monitored to evaluate the engine's status as ‚Äògood‚Äô or ‚Äòbad‚Äô. These features are:

* **Engine rpm (revolutions per minute)**
* **Lubrication oil pressure**
* **Fuel pressure**
* **Coolant pressure**
* **Lubrication oil temperature**
* **Coolant temperature**


## Objectives
- Preprocess the data and perform feature engineering to identify meaningful patterns.
- Develop and compare statistical and ML approaches for anomaly detection.
- Build a pipeline of actionable insights for predictive maintenance.

## Techniques Employed
1. **Data preprocessing:** cleaning, outlier handling, and visualisation.
2. **Statistical method:** Interquartile Range (IQR) for anomaly detection.
3. **ML models:** One Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Isolation Forest.
4. **Visualisation:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and 2D anomaly visualisation.

## Tools
- `Python`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## Results
- All methods identified a realistic anomaly ratio (1‚Äì5%) when properly tuned.
- IQR was effective for univariate detection but limited for multivariate anomalies. 
- Isolation Forest offered stable results across runs.
- One-Class SVM required careful hyperparameter tuning for reliable detection.
- PCA visualisations provided limited interpretability for stakeholders.

## Business Applications
The anomaly detection framework is industry-agnostic, with potential applications in different fields:
- **Finance:** Fraud detection.
- **Healthcare:** Early diagnosis.
- **Cybersecurity:** Intrusion detection.
- **Manufacturing:** Predictive maintenance.
