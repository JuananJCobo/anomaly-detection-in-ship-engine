# 🚢 Anomaly Detection in Ship Engine Data
Statistical and machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance using multivariate sensor data.

## 🌟Overview
This project applies statistical and machine learning frameworks to detect anomalous activity in ship engines using real-world sensor data (RPM, fuel pressure, coolant pressure, and lubrication metrics). Poorly maintained engines can cause safety risks, fuel inefficiencies, and costly downtime.

## 🎯Objectives
- Preprocess the data and perform feature engineering to identify meaningful patterns.
- Develop and compare statistical and ML approaches for anomaly detection.
- Build a pipeline of actionable insights for predictive maintenance.

## 🧠 Techniques Employed
1. **Data preprocessing:** cleaning, outlier handling, and visualization.
2. **Statistical method:** Interquartile Range (IQR) for anomaly detection.
3. **ML models:** One Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Isolation Forest.
4. **Visualization:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and 2D anomaly visualization.

## 🔧 Tools
- `Python`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

## 📊 Results
- All methods identified a realistic anomaly ratio (1–5%) when properly tuned.
- IQR was effective for univariate detection but limited for multivariate anomalies. 
- Isolation Forest offered stable results across runs.
- One-Class SVM required careful hyperparameter tuning for reliable detection.
- PCA visualizations provided limited interpretability for stakeholders.

## ➡️ Transferable Applications
The anomaly detection framework has potential applications in different fields:
- **Finance:** Fraud detection.
- **Healthcare:** Early diagnosis.
- **Cybersecurity:** Intrusion detection.
- **Manufacturing:** Predictive maintenance.
